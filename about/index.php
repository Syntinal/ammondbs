                History
            </h2>
            
            <p>Ammon-DBS was started by Nathan Wittmann in 2015. Nathan in package
               manufacturing for 8 years as a production manager. In this capacity
               he had the opportunity to manage a multi-million dollar inventory. 
               During this time Nathan had hands on experience of the complications
               of keeping track of inventory in an manufacturing environment. Nathan
               designed his first database to solve the problems he encountered. The
               design was implemented not by a computer programmer, but by a production/
               inventory managers mind set. Nathan then went and received a degree
               in CIT and began working on a new database to solve the common problems
               faced by manufactures
